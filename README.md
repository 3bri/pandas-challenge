Challenge 4 PyCitySchools

Current Status:
Was stuck at the beginning of the School Summary Section where starter file stated,  “# Use the code provided to select all of the school types” but no code was actually provided.  This was resolved during my tutor session on Tuesday where he confirmed that no code was included and that code was provided in the other two occurrences of “use the code provided”.  He was able to provide the code and then I was able to advance with the School Summary.

I then spent way too much time working out that the creation of the ‘per_school_summary’ dataframe did not require brackets in the dictionary due to the .groupby function.  I just figured that out this afternoon and the rest of the assignment utilizes this dataframe,  so I only have this assignment partially complete.  

I have now completed the PyCitySchools Analysis and the Written Analysis, see PyCitySchools_vers2.ipynb and PcCity_Schools_Written_Analysis.docx.  I utilized our class activities to complete the rest of this assignment.
